Note that the Brennan file has a different file type, unlike Sophia and Maddie. 
Sophia and Maddie merged their branches to the main and had to figure out how to solve the merge conflicts. Brennan merged smoothly but separately.
It was super great and Awesome. Git Hub is such a useful and powerful tool.
